Brick Breaker Game on the Christmas Tree - Version 2.1 (Grid-Based)

A fully playable brick breaker game that runs on a 500-LED Christmas tree.
This version uses a TRUE 3D GRID system based on angular sections and height bands,
creating properly mapped "faces" of the tree for accurate spatial gameplay.

Features:
- Grid-based bricks: 8 angular sections × 8 height bands = 64 bricks
- Bricks cover upper 2/3 of tree with alternating RED and GREEN pattern
- Each brick contains all LEDs within its angular/height cell
- Face-aware gameplay: Ball and paddle operate on the visible face
- Cylindrical coordinate system for proper 3D-to-2D mapping
- AI-controlled paddle at the bottom of the tree
- Win animation: Rainbow wave effect with smooth color transitions
- Loss animation: White wash cascading from top to bottom

Implementation:
- LEDs assigned to grid cells by (angle, height) coordinates
- Ball position tracked in cylindrical coordinates (angle, z)
- Collision detection uses angular distance, not just Y projection
- Visible face = ±72° from viewing angle (144° total visible)
- Checkerboard red/green pattern: (section + band) % 2

    Classic Brick Breaker game displayed on a 3D Christmas tree.
    
    This game uses a TRUE 3D GRID system that properly maps the tree's conical
    surface into a playable 2D game space. Instead of treating the tree as a
    flat surface, we divide it into angular sections (like pizza slices when
    viewed from above) and height bands (horizontal layers).
    
    How it works:
    - The tree is divided into 8 angular sections (45° each)
    - Each section is divided into 8 height bands
    - Each brick = one cell in this grid (section × band)
    - Bricks cover the upper 2/3 of the tree (from 33% to 100% height)
    - Gameplay happens on a "visible face" that rotates slowly around the tree
    
    Game Elements:
    - Paddle (white): AI-controlled, follows ball at the bottom of the tree
    - Ball (yellow): Bounces around, breaks bricks on contact
    - Bricks (red/green): Grid cells in a checkerboard pattern
    
    Why this approach is better:
    - Previous versions used sequential LED indices, which didn't match the
      tree's 3D structure. This version uses actual spatial coordinates.
    - Collision detection works in cylindrical space (angle + height), so
      the ball properly bounces off bricks that are actually next to each
      other in 3D space, not just in the LED string order.
