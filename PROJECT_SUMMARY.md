# Brick Breaker - Holiday Lights Contest Project Summary

**Project:** Brick Breaker Game for 500-LED Christmas Tree  
**Author:** Pat Buffolino  
**Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Status:** Complete and Ready for Submission

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project implements a fully playable **Brick Breaker game** that runs on a 3D Christmas tree with 500 programmable LEDs. The game transforms the tree into an interactive gaming display with classic arcade mechanics adapted for 3D spatial coordinates.

### Key Features

✨ **47 Individual Bricks** (5 lights each) with red/green alternation  
🎯 **Smart AI Paddle** that tracks the ball automatically  
🔄 **Rotating Gameplay** - cycles through 6 different tree faces  
🎨 **Spectacular Animations** - rainbow waves for wins, white wash for losses  
⚡ **Multiple Lives System** - 3 chances before game over  
🔁 **Auto-Reset** - continuous gameplay that never stops  

---

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Game Statistics
- **Total LEDs:** 500
- **Total Bricks:** 47 (5 lights each = 235 lights in play)
- **Brick Distribution:** Upper 60% of tree
- **Color Scheme:** Alternating red and green
- **Frame Rate:** 30 FPS
- **Game Area:** Y: [-0.35, 0.35], Z: [-0.40, 0.57]

### Game Parameters
```python
fps = 30                    # Smooth 30 FPS animation
ball_speed = 0.015         # Ball movement speed
paddle_speed = 0.02        # Paddle AI tracking speed
paddle_width = 0.25        # Paddle size (in game coords)
lights_per_brick = 5       # Lights per brick (creates 47 bricks)
rotation_speed = 0.003     # Tree rotation speed
```

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Sequential Brick Structure
**Decision:** Bricks are sequential groups of light indices (not horizontal slices)
- **Why:** More traditional brick-breaker feel with individual destruction
- **Implementation:** Bricks filter lights in upper 60% of tree, group by index
- **Result:** 47 discrete bricks that can be broken individually

```python
# Each brick structure:
{
    'indices': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],  # 5 consecutive light indices
    'active': True,
    'z_min': -0.12, 'z_max': 0.03,    # Spatial bounds for collision
    'y_min': -0.15, 'y_max': 0.21,
    'z_center': -0.045, 'y_center': 0.03
}
```

#### 2. YZ Plane Projection
**Decision:** Use Y (horizontal) and Z (vertical) for 2D game logic
- **Why:** Creates intuitive "front view" gameplay
- **Implementation:** Projects 3D coordinates onto 2D game plane
- **Result:** Natural brick-breaker mechanics on curved tree surface

#### 3. Spatial Collision Detection
**Decision:** Use bounding boxes (Y/Z ranges) for collision
- **Why:** More accurate than Z-slice collision
- **Implementation:** Check if ball is within brick's Y and Z bounds
- **Result:** Precise collision detection for individual bricks

#### 4. Rotating Gameplay
**Decision:** Game rotates around tree, cycling faces between games
- **Why:** Showcases full 3D tree, prevents visual repetition
- **Implementation:** Angle tracking with 6 evenly-spaced faces
- **Result:** Dynamic perspective that utilizes entire tree

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Ball Physics
- Velocity-based movement (separate Y and Z velocities)
- Wall bounce with velocity inversion
- Paddle impact adds horizontal spin based on hit position
- Gravity-free (maintains vertical velocity)

### Paddle AI
```python
# Simple but effective tracking algorithm
if ball_y > paddle_y + 0.02:
    paddle_y += paddle_speed
elif ball_y < paddle_y - 0.02:
    paddle_y -= paddle_speed
```
- Tracks ball with slight lag for realism
- Clamped to game boundaries
- Creates engaging gameplay without user input

### Collision System
- **Walls:** Instant velocity reversal
- **Paddle:** Bounce up + horizontal spin based on hit position
- **Bricks:** Velocity reversal + brick destruction + cooldown
- **Cooldown:** 5-frame delay prevents multiple brick hits

### Lives & Reset
- Ball can fall 3 times (loss on every 3rd fall)
- Auto-reset ball position after each fall
- Game-over triggers 4-second white wash animation
- Win triggers 3-second rainbow wave animation
- Both auto-reset to new game after animation

## 🌈 Special Animations

### Win Animation (Rainbow Wave)
```python
# Smooth expanding rainbow waves
- 3 concurrent waves with different offsets
- Slow hue rotation (0.005 speed)
- Gentle pulsing brightness (0.03 speed)
- Wide, smooth wave transitions (0.25 width)
- Duration: 90 frames (3 seconds at 30 FPS)
```

### Loss Animation (White Wash)
```python
# Cascading white wash from top to bottom
- Smooth gradient transition band
- Top-to-bottom progression
- White color with graduated brightness
- Duration: 120 frames (4 seconds at 30 FPS)
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Spatial Awareness:** Uses actual 3D coordinates for natural brick placement
2. **Individual Bricks:** Sequential grouping creates distinct, breakable units
3. **Smart AI:** Paddle AI creates engaging gameplay without user input
4. **Visual Spectacle:** Win/loss animations showcase full LED capabilities
5. **Continuous Play:** Auto-reset ensures endless entertainment
6. **Tree Utilization:** Rotation showcases all sides of the 3D tree

### Challenges Solved

**Problem:** Horizontal slices affected entire tree ring  
**Solution:** Sequential light groups for individual bricks

**Problem:** Paddle hard to see on single row  
**Solution:** Increased Z-tolerance for better visibility

**Problem:** Multiple brick hits per frame  
**Solution:** Cooldown system prevents double-counting

**Problem:** Game ends and stops  
**Solution:** Auto-reset with spectacular transition animations
